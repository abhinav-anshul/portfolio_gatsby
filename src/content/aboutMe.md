I’m **Fidalgo**, a 23 years old self-taught **Front-end developer**, from **Portugal**.

After my college degree in _"Communication & Multimedia"_, I got a job as a "developer", where I stayed for almost 2 years, but I only developed websites with Wordpress custom themes, and HTML & CSS… So I _wasn’t learning and improving_, I _felt stuck_.

In October 2018 I decided it was _time for a change_, so I started to wake up at 6am to _study javascript before going into work_. I quickly started to _love Javascript_, and in January 2019 I decided to _take the risk and quit my job_. I’ve been studying Front-end development full time ever since.

During this time, I took online courses like [The Complete Javascript Course](), [Javascript30](), [Understanding the Weird Parts](), [ES6](), [Advanced React w/ Redux](), [React: The Complete Guide](), [Gatsby Bootcamp](), and also read book series ["You don’t know JS"](). Because we the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you can check them [here](#portolio). And I even started my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8pnh6gmhMP-hyQ6MJb414g), here I already have some tutorials about React, Redux and Firebase.

I always want to _learn more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m also a firm believer that we should **never settle**.

I’m _hard working_, _super curious_, _passionate_, _committed_, and also a _fast learner_!
